# IoT-based-noise-pollution-monitoring-system-2
A noise monitoring system is to be developed consisting of sensors as a hardware part. Sensors will detect the surrounding noise and send the data to the arduino . If a threshold value is crossed it will be indicated through a virtual terminal.
This data will be sent to the internet through establishing a connection via firebase and will be displayed on a website.
Website will give a graphical representation of the noise levels in the surrounding area .
